## qarsan
a _bit_ of truth

### problem

Freedom of the press promotes better governance, but as long as media is centralized, it is susceptible to takedown.

### description
Qarsan is a decentralized mobile app based off bittorent and Tor, allowing citizen reporting to a news portal that is hosted by everyone who installs the app. Thus, it is uncensorable, un-DDoS-able and will amplify the true voice of the population.

### name

Qarsan means "pirate‚Äù in Arabic; and this app is about creating a pirate news source for citizen journalists. It leverages the DHT primitive and BitTorrent to create a peer-to-peer network for authorship and validation of user-generated journalism.
